BOOTSTRAP EVERYTHING
======================

Task
----
1. Create 2 lists and 2 buttons.
2. When the first list gets empty (eg. the initial state) enable 1 button to fill it with the names of your mates
3. While the first list remains filled with names, enable the 2nd button to be able to transfer randomly elements from one list to other. Remember to disable the 1st button so the user won't be able to fill the list until it gets empty.
4. When all the names are transferred enable again the 1st button so the user can fill again the 1st list and empty the 2nd one
